With the release of Shadowlands, in the Blizzard interface in the numbers between the thousands, there were no gaps. Because of this, large amounts at auction or at merchants are difficult to read. The current addon just adds a space between the numbers when there are thousands, thus making it easier to visualize large numbers. An example of an addon can be seen in the attached picture. If earlier numbers were written like 1000, now it's like 1 000.

 

Added the ability to independently set the separator for large numbers (space by default) Command /zam (for example /zam , or /zam .)
